# My Model View Controller(MVC) principle for PHP

This is my Model View Controller for PHP.
If errors occur or an improvement is found, please simply open a request.

Excuse my poor English.

Tested PHP-Versions:
- 7.0
- 7.1
- 7.2
- 7.3

PHP versions below 7.0 can get errors because of the unique type assignment.
If you wan't to run it anyway, they must be removed first.
